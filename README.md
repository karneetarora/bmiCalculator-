About: The objective of the program is to create an Android App that can calculate a user's BMI based on their weight and age. 

Background: This project is an assignment for Software Methodology (CS213) and was completed by my partner and I. It's an introductory program to get affiliated with using Android Studio, screens, activity, and image handling.

Break-Down:
- First Activity - the first screen that appears; prompts user to select unit of measurement and enter their height and weight. Displays the user's BMI when the calculate button is clicked.
- Second Activity - displays an image describing the user's BMI category based on the user's BMI.
